Additional information regarding the Code:

Getters and Setters are left out on purpose.
We used a plugin called "Lombok" which can be found for at least IntelliJ and Eclipse that generates Getters, Setters
and Constructors by itself if the correct Annotations are used.
In this case the used Annotations are:
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor

Other Tools that were used:

SpringBoot
